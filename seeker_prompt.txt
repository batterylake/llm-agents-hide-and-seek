!<ENVIRONMENT>!

Please output your strategy as a series of locations you wish to search, followed by the thoroughness of your search for each location. Thoroughness levels are 'quick' and 'thorough'. Thorough guarentees you will find them in that location, while quick gives a !<QUICK_PROBABILITY>! chance. A thorough search costs !<THOROUGH_COST>! points, and a quick search costs !<QUICK_COST>! point. You have !<TOTAL_POINTS>! total points to spend.

Format your strategy as follows:

`<location_1>: <thoroughness_1>`

`<location_2>: <thoroughness_2>`

...

For example:

`house.living_room.couch: thorough`

`house.bedroom.bed: quick`
